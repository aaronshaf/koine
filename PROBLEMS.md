## Memorizaing Lemmas

> "Mounce et al have students learn lemmas, or lexical forms. For example, the
student learns Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Ï‰ as â€˜I take.â€™ When she opens her Greek NT, however, she may
encounter words like Î»Î¬Î²Îµ, Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Î¿Î½Ï„Î±Î¹, Îµá¼°Î»Î®Ï†ÎµÎ¹Î½, Îµá¼°Î»Î·Î¼Î¼Î­Î½Î±, Î»Î·ÏˆÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ¸Î±. Many of these
hardly look like Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Ï‰ at all. I regularly encounter students in their 3rd
and 4th year of Greek who canâ€™t recognize these words to save their life (or their
grade ðŸ˜‰ ), yet according to Mounceâ€™s way of counting, the student knows them." ([Daniel R. Streett](https://danielstreett.com/2014/04/03/greek-vocabulary-are-we-cooking-the-books/))

## Knowing a word

> "When we talk about learning a new vocabulary word in English, it usually
entails being able to 1) recognize it and comprehend it quickly (whether in
written or audio form), 2) spell it, 3) pronounce it correctly, 4) use it in a
sentence, 5) provide a definition for it, 6) provide synonyms for it, 7) know its
connotations and collocations, and 8) locate it semantically in relation to other
possible word choices."
