### Communicative

> "Particularly in the early stages, pragmatic communication skills are regularly prioritized over grammatical analysis. Students are not only able to comprehend more than they can produce, but they are also able to use language that they cannot analyze yet."

## Questions

* What are the various meanings of "long" and "short" vowels? 
  * "short" can _either_ refer to closed/open, or to whether lengthened?
* What are the American idiosyncracies of Erasmian?
* What are the differences between different constructed pronunciations (say, between Polis Institute and Biblical Language Center)?
* Are there audible examples (i.e. on YouTube) of classic Greek pitch accents instead of stress accents?
